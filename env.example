# DoorBird Configuration
# Replace these values with your DoorBird device's actual settings

# The base URL of your DoorBird device (without trailing slash)
# Example: http://192.168.1.100 or http://doorbird.local
DOORBIRD_URL=http://192.168.1.100

# DoorBird username (typically 6 characters + 4 digits)
# You can find this in the DoorBird app under Settings â†’ Administration
DOORBIRD_USER=abcdef0001

# DoorBird password
# This is the password you set for the user account
DOORBIRD_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# WebRTC Configuration
# The public IP address of your server for NAT traversal
# This should be the IP address that WebRTC clients will connect to
# 
# - For Docker: Set this to your host machine's LAN IP (required)
# - For native runs: Optional, will auto-detect your LAN IP if not set
# 
# Example: Your Docker host's external IP
HOST_IP=192.168.1.50

# UDP port for WebRTC media (ICE/STUN)
# This port must be exposed in your Docker configuration
UDP_PORT=50000

# Audio Fanout Configuration
# Number of audio samples to buffer in the fanout queue
# Each sample is 20ms, so this directly affects audio latency
# Lower values = lower latency but more susceptible to dropouts/crackling
# Higher values = smoother playback but noticeable delay in two-way communication
# For intercom use, lower latency is generally preferred
# Recommended: 20-30 samples (400-600ms)
AUDIO_FANOUT_BUFFER_SAMPLES=20

# Video Fanout Configuration
# Number of video frames to buffer in the fanout queue
# Lower values = lower latency but more frame drops
# Higher values = higher latency but smoother video
# Recommended: 4-5 frames (~330-420ms @ 12fps)
VIDEO_FANOUT_BUFFER_FRAMES=4

# Logging Configuration
# Set to one of: trace, debug, info, warn, error
# Use "info" for normal operation, "debug" for troubleshooting
RUST_LOG=info
